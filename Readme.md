# Examples



# GoLearn
GoLearn offers the ease of simplicity with the power of customization. This Machine Learning library implements its interfaces in the same manner as Python's Scikit-Learn. In addition, with helper functions for test-splitting and cross-validation, GoLearn provides the relevant resources developers need to manage their data integrity.

The library contains a combination of C++ and Golang code. However, native Go code is the predominant language, with C++ only used for the library's linear model. This Golang support enables developers to interact with many components directly, resulting in faster and more efficient code.

# Gorgonia
Gorgonia is a Machine Learning graph computation-based library. It is built for performance and can scale across multiple servers. It also provides a platform for the exploration of non-standard deep-learning and neural network solutions. Some of the features it offers include neo-Hebbian learning, corner-cutting, and evolutionary algorithms.

Built on the Go platform, Gorgonia offers a seamless environment for Golang developers. The library's creators designed the platform to bridge the gap between the two processes of a typical Machine Learning solution, the experimental and deployment phases. Standard ML solutions use Python for the first stage and then refactor the code into C++ or something similar for performance. As Go is faster than Python and built on the same syntax as C++, the Gorgonia library simplifies this process with a single codebase for both phases.

# eaopt
eaopt is another Machine Learning library written in Go. This solution leverages evolutionary optimization algorithms that minimize or maximize a function without using gradient information. eaopt offers several evolutionary algorithms that utilize a consistent API. This capability means that developers can write a single Machine Learning use case in Go and seamlessly integrate it with all the algorithms in the library.

This Go Machine Learning library also offers speciation and migration procedures. In addition, it provides native support for familiar genetic operators such as mutation, crossover, and selection. eaopt also offers parallel function evaluation that developers can use to improve the performance of their solution.

# GoMind
GoMind is a neural network Machine Learning library. Written entirely in Go, this platform learns from a training set that uses a back-propagation algorithm. It supports activation functions such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Leaky ReLU and can estimate the ideal number of hidden layer neurons.

GoMind does not have the depth and features of the more popular Machine Learning platforms like Scikit-Learn or Tensorflow. However, it is a sound library that offers a simple platform for training. Consequently, it allows Go developers to start Machine Learning without worrying about creating Python models and binding them with C or C++.

# goml
goml is another Machine Learning library written in Golang. Its format and structure enable developers to integrate Machine Learning directly into their solutions. It offers several ML models, including generalized linear models, perception, clustering, and text classification.

goml also provides a set of features that simplify the process of integrating a Machine Learning solution. With modular source code, extensive documentation, comprehensive tests, and a clean and expressive code base, goml provides online and reactive learning functionality.

# Goga
Goga is a genetic Machine Learning library created in Go. Its features allow developers to inject different behaviors into the main genetic algorithm object. Using three injectable components simulators, selectors, and mater, it offers the functionality needed to solve genome-related compatibility issues.

The library comes with several features that help researchers integrate its functionality into their solution, including a string and image matcher. In addition, it can take multiple inputs and present a correlated solution that depicts the union of the various input objects.
